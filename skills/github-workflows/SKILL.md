description: GitHub workflows — listing/searching/creating issues and PRs, looking up users and repos, paginating large result sets, handling rate limits, and the search-then-get pattern. Activate this skill BEFORE making any GitHub call when the user asks anything involving issues, pull requests, repositories, commits, releases, GitHub users, organisations, or anything on github.com.

# GitHub Workflows

## Namespaces

Calls go through `gateway.<ns>.<method>(args)` from inside `execute_javascript`
or `execute_python`. Never call them as top-level tools.

| Namespace | Notes |
|---|---|
| `gateway.gh.*` | OpenAPI-typed. Methods are **camelCase** (`issuesListForRepo`, `usersGetByUsername`). TYPED API SURFACE has the exact shapes; full file at `/workspace/interfaces.ts`. |

**Naming**: method is camelCase, args are snake_case (`per_page`, `issue_number`, `pull_number`, `q`).
If a call returns `gateway.gh.foo is not a workspace tool`, the error lists every valid method — pick from it. Never re-send the same call.

## Cardinal rules

1. **Don't fabricate.** Issue numbers, SHAs, usernames, URLs — every one comes from a tool result.
2. **`owner` and `repo` always required.** No "current repo" default.
3. **Cap pagination.** Default to 1–3 pages of `per_page: 100`; stop early.
4. **Render every linkable thing as a markdown link** using the response's `html_url` field.

## Counting (how many / total / top-N)

For any **"how many"**, **"count"**, **"number of"**, or **"top N raisers/authors/labels"** question, use search and read `total_count`. **Do not** list-then-`.length` — `issuesListForRepo` caps at 100/page so the count is wrong on any large repo, and the payload wastes context.

```javascript
const r = await gateway.gh.searchIssuesAndPullRequests({
  q: "repo:embabel/embabel-agent is:issue is:open",
  per_page: 1,            // count-only — items not needed
});
console.log(`Open issues: ${r.total_count}`);
```

| Question | `q` |
|---|---|
| open issues in repo | `repo:owner/name is:issue is:open` |
| closed issues in repo | `repo:owner/name is:issue is:closed` |
| open PRs in repo | `repo:owner/name is:pr is:open` |
| issues by author | `repo:owner/name author:login` |
| issues with label | `repo:owner/name label:bug is:open` |

For top-N-by-author / top-N-by-label, paginate the same `searchIssuesAndPullRequests` call and aggregate client-side — its per-item shape is much smaller than `issuesListForRepo`.

## Listing issues / PRs

```javascript
const r = await gateway.gh.issuesListForRepo({
  owner, repo,
  state: "open",          // open | closed | all   (default: open)
  sort: "created",        // created | updated | comments
  direction: "desc",
  per_page: 30,
});
// r is a bare array. Each item: number, title, state, user.login, html_url,
// created_at, updated_at, labels[], assignees[]. PRs are also returned —
// filter with `i.pull_request !== undefined` for PRs only, or use pullsList.
```

If the user gives a number, fetch directly — don't list-and-filter:
```javascript
await gateway.gh.issuesGet({ owner, repo, issue_number: 42 });
```

## Searching content

Search returns `{ total_count, items, incomplete_results }` — **not** a bare array.

```javascript
const s = await gateway.gh.searchIssuesAndPullRequests({
  q: "repo:embabel/embabel-agent state:open label:bug pagination",
  per_page: 10,
});
for (const hit of s.items) console.log(`#${hit.number} ${hit.title} — ${hit.html_url}`);
```

Useful operators: `repo:`, `org:`, `user:`, `is:open|closed|merged`, `state:`, `label:`, `author:`, `assignee:`, `mentions:`, `created:>2025-01-01`, `updated:<2026-01-01`, `in:title`, `in:body`.

## Paginating safely

```javascript
let all = [];
for (let page = 1; page <= 3; page++) {                // hard cap
  const r = await gateway.gh.issuesListForRepo({ owner, repo, state: "all", per_page: 100, page });
  if (!r || r.length === 0) break;                     // empty page → done
  all.push(...r);
  if (r.length < 100) break;                           // partial page → last page
}
```

Both break conditions are required. Without `r.length < 100` you waste one extra request.

## Users and repos

```javascript
await gateway.gh.usersGetByUsername({ username: "johnsonr" });
// fields: login, name, bio, company, blog, location, public_repos, followers, html_url, avatar_url

await gateway.gh.usersGetAuthenticated();              // no args — current user

await gateway.gh.reposGet({ owner, repo });            // metadata
await gateway.gh.reposGetReadme({ owner, repo });
await gateway.gh.reposGetLatestRelease({ owner, repo });
await gateway.gh.reposListForUser({ username });
await gateway.gh.reposListForAuthenticatedUser({ per_page: 100 });
```

## Writing — issues and comments

Confirm with the user first; both are publicly visible.

```javascript
const i = await gateway.gh.issuesCreate({
  owner, repo,
  title: "Short imperative title",
  body: "## Context\n…\n## Repro\n…\n## Expected\n…",
  labels: ["bug"],
});

await gateway.gh.issuesCreateComment({ owner, repo, issue_number: 42, body: "…" });
```

## Pitfalls

- Method names are **camelCase**; arg names are **snake_case**. Most "not a workspace tool" errors come from snake_case method names.
- Search uses **`q`**, not `query`.
- Search returns `{ total_count, items }`; listings return a bare array.
- Field is **`i.user.login`**, not `i.author.login`.
- `per_page` silently caps at 100.
- `state` defaults to `open` — pass `"all"` to include closed.
- Auth limit: 5,000 req/h; **search limit: 30 req/min** — never loop a search.
